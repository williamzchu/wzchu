Written by Paul, where he starts with proclaiming God. Every prayer and request will always innately have God in it, and hopefully with the "will of God" eventually come to you. Interesting to note that it is the "will," and not himself that comes to God, but an understanding that in the end, God is the one with that has the final plan. Obligated to preach to everyone, no matter who it is. Wrath of God revealed in the unrighteous, even though they know the law and of God, they didn't honor it, and resulted in being giving over to sin and corruptible man.
