Everyone is judged according to God, and we cannot avoid the law. Having no law results in perishing, but having the law and sinning is still fatal. 
Furthermore, the law needs to be followed, even by the lawmakers themselves. Cannot simply state the law, but also need to follow it. The law doesn't change, yet it is still so easy to obtain. It doesn't matter the law or ceremony, God only cares about righteousness.
